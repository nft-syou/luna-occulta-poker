No-Limit Texas Hold'em under an eclipsed moon. You sit down as あるじどの; across the
lacquer table are five 御霊 whose personalities are lifted from the official canon —
咲耶, マミ, タルト, 孫市 and 蛇ノ目. Every one of their decisions is made by
[TypeSafe Jev](https://typesafe.ai); they speak their lines aloud, wear their official
faces at the seats, and get a cut-in on all-ins, big pots and busts. Or let a
full table of spirits play while you watch. Bring your own credentials: a TypeSafe API
key, or a Vercel, Lolipop or Cloudflare AI Gateway of your own.

Built on [jev-poker](https://github.com/nft-syou/jev-poker): the engine and the CPU are
unchanged (`@jev-poker/engine`, `@jev-poker/agent`); the look, the characters and the
voices are the fan work.

## The spirits

| Spirit | Clan | Canon | At the table |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 咲耶 Sakuya | Koga · Fire | Bright and confident; cannot lie, and it shows on her face | Plays strong hands head-on, almost never bluffs. **Her lines change when she bluffs** — a tell |
| マミ Mami | Saika · Wood | Shape-shifter who wins by showing people a dream | Bluffs and semi-bluffs often, wins on numbers |
| タルト Tart | Koga · Water | "The long way round is the quick way" | Enters few pots, calls, raises only with the goods |
| 孫市 Magoichi | Saika · Fire | "Never missed a shot" | Selective, then aggressive for value; takes the whole pot |
| 蛇ノ目 Janome | Fuma · Wood | Easygoing and fatally off-beat | Loose, unreadable; shoves with the unexpected |
| あるじどの | — | Speaks no word | Your seat; in spectator mode, a silent CPU |

The personality texts are in `src/characters/spirits.ts` and the script in `src/characters/lines.ts`.

## How it works

1. The game engine (`src/engine`, zero dependencies) deals, enforces betting rules, builds side pots and evaluates hands.
2. For every CPU decision, `src/jev` compresses the situation (position, made hand, draws, exact hand strength and equity, pot odds, stacks in BB, this hand's actions) and asks Jev three typed questions in one call: `action` (choice among the legal options), `sizing` (score 0–5) and `bluff_intent` (yes/no probability).
3. Jev returns probabilities. The persona's *variance* decides whether the CPU always takes the most likely action or samples. The result is clamped to a legal bet size.
4. If Jev is unreachable the CPU checks or folds and the history shows why.

Your credentials never leave your browser except inside requests to this site's
`/api/jev/*` proxy (a Cloudflare Pages Function), which forwards them with
`Authorization: Bearer <your key>` and stores nothing.

## Play

1. Open the deployed site (or run it locally, below).
2. Pick a route and enter its credentials when asked (see below). They are stored in your browser only.
3. Choose seats (2–6), which seat is あるじどの, a spirit for each seat, blinds, stack and whether the spirits speak. With no human seat you get spectator mode.
4. Open "Jev" in the hand history to see the probabilities behind each CPU action.

## Routes

The connection modal offers four ways to reach Jev. Pick one; you can change it
at any time from the button in the header.

| Route | You provide | Requests go to | Model | Billed by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TypeSafe direct | a TypeSafe API key | `https://api.typesafe.ai` | `jev-latest` | TypeSafe |
| Vercel AI Gateway | a Vercel AI Gateway API key | `https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/typesafe` | `typesafe-ai/jev` | Vercel (or your own TypeSafe key if you added one there) |
| Lolipop AI Gateway | a Lolipop AI Gateway API key | `https://ai-gateway.lolipop.jp` | `typesafe/jev-latest` | Lolipop (prepaid credit, in yen) |
| Cloudflare AI Gateway | a TypeSafe API key + account id, gateway id, custom provider slug, optional gateway token | `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account}/{gateway}/custom-{slug}` | `jev-latest` | TypeSafe (Cloudflare adds logging, caching and rate limits) |

### Vercel AI Gateway

1. Vercel dashboard → AI Gateway → **API keys** → create a key (`vck_…`).
2. Paste it as the AI Gateway API key. Nothing else is needed: the gateway speaks the TypeSafe API at `https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/typesafe`, and the app asks for the model id `typesafe-ai/jev`.
3. Optional BYOK: add your own TypeSafe key under the gateway's provider settings and Vercel routes the calls with it, so TypeSafe bills you instead.

### Lolipop AI Gateway

1. [ai-gateway.lolipop.jp](https://ai-gateway.lolipop.jp/) → your project → **API keys** → create a key, and make sure the project may call `typesafe/jev-latest`.
2. Paste it as the Lolipop AI Gateway API key. Nothing else is needed: the gateway serves the same `POST /v1/systemone` ([typed probabilistic decisions](https://ai-gateway.lolipop.jp/docs/guides/features/probabilistic-decision)) and the app asks for the model id `typesafe/jev-latest`.
3. Calls are charged to the organization's prepaid credit. When it runs out the gateway answers 402 and the table pauses with a top-up prompt.

### Cloudflare AI Gateway

1. Cloudflare dashboard → AI → **AI Gateway** → create a gateway. Note its **gateway id** and your **account id** (the 32-character hex id in the dashboard URL).
2. In that gateway, add a **custom provider** with base URL `https://api.typesafe.ai` and give it a slug, e.g. `typesafe`. The request URL becomes `…/custom-typesafe/v1/systemone`; the app adds the `custom-` prefix for you, so paste the slug alone.
3. In jev-poker pick "Cloudflare AI Gateway" and fill in your TypeSafe API key, the account id, the gateway id and the slug.
4. If the gateway is **authenticated**, create a gateway token and paste it into "Gateway token"; it is sent as `cf-aig-authorization`.

### Security

The proxy never accepts a URL from the browser. It chooses one of four fixed
hosts from a route id (`typesafe`, `vercel`, `lolipop`, `cloudflare`) and interpolates only
values that matched an anchored regex server-side — account id `[0-9a-f]{32}`,
gateway id `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}`, provider slug `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,62}` with no
`custom-` prefix left on it, keys and tokens printable ASCII up to 512
characters — after `encodeURIComponent`.
Anything else is a 400 and the upstream is never contacted. Only
`POST /v1/systemone` and `GET /v1/models` are forwarded, upstream headers are
built from scratch (none of the app's own `X-*` headers travel on), and nothing
is logged or stored on the server. To report a vulnerability, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 24 and pnpm.

    pnpm install
    pnpm dev          # Vite dev server; /api/jev runs the very same proxy handler as the Pages Function
    pnpm dev:pages    # build + `wrangler pages dev dist` with the real Pages Function
    pnpm check        # lint + typecheck + tests + build

`pnpm dev:pages` requires `wrangler` to be able to run (it is installed as a
dev dependency, no separate install needed); `.node-version` pins this project
to Node 24 for tools that read it.

## Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

The official instance is [jev-poker.syou.io](https://jev-poker.syou.io/), deployed from `main` through the Cloudflare Pages Git integration. To run your own:

1. Fork or push this repo to GitHub.
2. Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages → Create → Pages → connect the repo.
3. Build command `pnpm build`, output directory `dist`. Set the environment variable `NODE_VERSION=24`.
4. Functions in `functions/` are deployed automatically. No secrets are needed: players bring their own credentials.

Optional variable `TYPESAFE_BASE_URL` overrides the upstream API root of the
`typesafe` route only; the gateway hosts are constants in the code. It is
used only when it looks like `https://…` (or `http://localhost…` for local
work); anything else falls back to the default.

## Assets and voices

- The faces, standing art and cut-in drawings under `public/kitan/` come from the official
  fan-work materials and asset vault (each cut-in is one frame lifted from the official
  animation; the motion is staged here); sources and processing are in `scripts/kitan-assets.json`
  and `pnpm assets:kitan` rebuilds them. They belong to the original work and are not covered by
  this repository's MIT license ([public/kitan/README.md](public/kitan/README.md)).
- The voices are mp3s generated with [Irodori-TTS](https://github.com/Aratako/Irodori-TTS)'s
  VoiceDesign model from the caption and seed published with each spirit's official voice sample.
  Edit a line and regenerate only that clip: see [scripts/voice/README.md](scripts/voice/README.md).
- The music and sound effects are CC0 from 宵闇素材庫 (<https://vibe.co.jp/yoiyami/>): one quiet
  koto loop under the table and a handful of short sounds, kept sparse because the official tone
  sheet makes silence the ground.
- The design follows the official tone, 宵闇に金: an indigo ground, gold as lines and grains,
  eclipse red only for warnings and all-ins.

## Benchmark

`pnpm bench` seats the game's own Jev CPU against three baseline bots (`random`, `caller`, a
rule-based `rules`) and reports bb/100 with a 95% confidence interval. Every deal is replayed with
the Jev seat rotated (mirrored hands), heads-up and six-handed. `pnpm bench:slumbot` plays
[Slumbot](https://www.slumbot.com/), a real heads-up poker AI, through its public API.

    TYPESAFE_API_KEY=... pnpm bench --opponent rules --format all --seeds 1000
    pnpm bench --backend mock --seeds 100     # dry run, no key, no cost
    pnpm bench:report                         # re-render saved results

What the measurements say (`tag` persona, 1,000 seeds on seeds never used for tuning):

| opponent | heads-up bb/100 | 6-max bb/100 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rules` bot | **+48.8** [+38.4, +59.1] | **+11.3** [-0.2, +22.8] |
| Slumbot (200 bb, 12,000 hands) | -49.4 [-65.8, -33.0] | — |

The `rules` row is the game's CPU as shipped. The Slumbot row was measured before the agent was
ported onto the game's engine, where the same agent scored +62.7 [+48.7, +76.8] and +12.9
[+1.3, +24.5] against `rules`.

- The CPU this game first shipped with did not beat the rule-based bot (-4.5 heads-up, -24.5
  six-handed); on the same deals the current one is **+53.2 [+31.5, +75.0]** and
  **+35.8 [+9.9, +61.7]** bb/100 better. It wins now because of what it is told
  (exact hand strength, equity against pot odds, whether its bet was raised, pot commitment,
  blind-stealing spots) and conventional preflop raise sizes. The strength comes from the code
  around the model.
- A fixed heuristic over the same features is 30 to 50 bb/100 behind Jev heads-up and level with it
  six-handed; against Slumbot Jev, the heuristic and the rules bot all lose about 50 bb/100.
- What Jev adds is authoring: a persona is a paragraph of text, every decision comes with
  probabilities to show, and a new character costs no new code.

## Roadmap

- Tournament format: `BlindSchedule` already abstracts blinds; busted seats are not rebought when `format` is `tournament`.
- Versioned question sets recorded on each decision.

## Use it as a library

The engine and the CPU are published on npm:

- [`@jev-poker/engine`](packages/engine) — the No-Limit Hold'em engine, zero dependencies.
- [`@jev-poker/agent`](packages/agent) — the Jev CPU, baseline bots, personas and `playHand`.

Each package's README shows the minimal usage. Changes are released with Changesets; see
